The main entry point of the plugin is a single command, ":Switch". When the command is executed, the plugin looks for one of a few specific patterns under the cursor and performs a substition depending on the pattern. For example, if the cursor is on the "true" in the following code:

    flag = true

Then, upon executing ":Switch", the "true" will turn into "false".

It is highly recommended to map the ":Switch" command to a key. For example, to map it to "-", place the following in your .vimrc:

    nnoremap - :Switch<cr>

Here's a list of all the built-in switch definitions. To see the actual definitions with their patterns and replacements, look at the file plugin/switch.vim.

  Boolean conditions:
      foo && bar
      foo || bar

      flag = true
      flag = false

Ruby:

  Hash style:
      foo = { :one => 'two' }
      foo = { one: 'two' }

  If-clauses:
      if predicate?
        puts 'Hello, World!'
      end

      if true and (predicate?)
        puts 'Hello, World!'
      end

      if false or (predicate?)
        puts 'Hello, World!'
      end

  Rspec should/should_not:
      1.should eq 1
      1.should_not eq 1

PHP:

  "Echo" in tags:
      <?php "Text" ?>
      <?php echo "Text" ?>

Eruby:

        <%= 'Hello, World!' %>
